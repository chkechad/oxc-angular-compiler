//! Resolve defer deps functions phase.
//!
//! Resolves dependency functions for defer blocks.
//!
//! This phase creates dependency resolver functions for @defer blocks that
//! have lazy-loaded components. The resolver function is called when the
//! defer block is triggered to load the necessary dependencies.
//!
//! In Angular's implementation:
//! 1. `ownResolverFn` is set during ingestion from `deferMeta.blocks` when
//!    a defer block has lazy-loaded dependencies
//! 2. This phase only processes defer blocks where `ownResolverFn` is set
//! 3. The resolver is added to the constant pool via `getSharedFunctionReference`
//!
//! Ported from Angular's `template/pipeline/src/phases/resolve_defer_deps_fns.ts`.
